// In JVM IR, SharedVariablesLowering transforms `x` into a shared variable to be able to update it from a lambda,
// which is a separate function (...$lambda-0).
// If we keep the existing representation of lambda bodies as separate functions in JVM IR, the only viable option to fix this test
// seems to support this case in the bytecode optimization pass CapturedVarsOptimizationMethodTransformer.
